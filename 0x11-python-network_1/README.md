Overview

This repository presents a series of tasks designed to familiarize you with using Python for handling web requests and processing web data.

You will learn to utilize Python's urllib and requests modules to send HTTP requests to web servers and effectively process their responses.

Tasks

The repository includes the following tasks:

Task 0: What's my status? #0
Write a Python script to fetch https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/status.

Task 1: Response header value #0
Write a Python script that takes a URL, sends a request, and displays the value of the X-Request-Id variable found in the response header.

Task 2: POST an email #0
Write a Python script that takes a URL and an email address, sends a POST request with the email as a parameter, and displays the response body.

Task 3: Error code #0
Write a Python script that takes a URL, sends a request, and displays the response body. If the HTTP status code is 400 or greater, print "Error code:" followed by the status code.

Task 4: What's my status? #1
Write a Python script to fetch https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/status using the requests package.

Task 5: Response header value #1
Write a Python script that takes a URL, sends a request using requests, and displays the value of the X-Request-Id variable in the response header.

Task 6: POST an email #1
Write a Python script that takes a URL and an email address, sends a POST request using requests with the email as a parameter, and displays the response body.

Task 7: Error code #1
Write a Python script that takes a URL, sends a request using requests, and displays the response body. If the HTTP status code is 400 or greater, print "Error code:" followed by the status code.

Task 8: Search API
