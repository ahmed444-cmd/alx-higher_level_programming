This repository, named 0x10-python-network_0, encompasses 10 tasks designed for the Python Network #0 project. These tasks delve into fundamental concepts such as cURL, HTTP and HTTPS protocols, headers, and web scraping.

The tasks are as follows:

Task 0: 0-body_size.sh

Implement a Bash script that retrieves the size of the response body in bytes from a given URL.
Task 1: 1-body.sh

Develop a Bash script that fetches and displays the body of the response from a specified URL using a GET request.
Task 2: 2-delete.sh

Create a Bash script that sends a DELETE request to a provided URL and displays the response body.
Task 3: 3-methods.sh

Construct a Bash script that identifies and displays all HTTP methods supported by a server for a given URL.
Task 4: 4-header.sh

Write a Bash script that sends a GET request to a URL, displaying the response body, and includes a header variable X-HolbertonSchool-User-Id with a value of 98.
Task 5: 5-post_params.sh

Design a Bash script that sends a POST request to a specified URL, displaying the response body, and setting specific variables (email and subject).
Task 6: 6-peak.py

Develop a Python function find_peak(list_of_integers) that identifies a peak element within an unsorted list of integers, aiming for a time complexity of O(log(n)).
Task 100: 100-status_code.sh

Create a Bash script that sends a request to a provided URL and displays only the status code of the response.
Task 101: 101-post_json.sh

Implement a Bash script that sends a JSON POST request to a specified URL and displays the response body.
Task 102: 102-catch_me.sh

Write a Bash script that interacts with a server at 0.0.0.0:5000/catch_me, causing the server to respond with the message "You got me!". Display the server's response.
These tasks collectively explore various aspects of network programming and scripting using Bash and Python.
